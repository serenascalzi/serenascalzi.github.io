          <h2>Instructional Designer, Creative Educator, and Lifelong Learner</h2>
          <p>I seek to educate and empower through creative digital design.</p>
          <p>As a graduate assistant in the Office of Online Education at UNLV, I assist teams of instructional designers and technologists in developing courses, resources, and assessments to support faculty and students in remote learning. As a graduate student in Educational Technology at UNLV, my research focuses on the intersection of education, technology, and creativity.</p>

              <p>This design presents information regarding Vincent van Gogh’s life and work. It also includes links to additional information from The Met and the Van Gogh Museum.</p>
              <p>The painting thumbnails in this gallery, which become active when a user hovers over them, are displayed in a matrix. When a user clicks on a thumbnail, the full painting is displayed on the screen. When the full painting is displayed, it acts as an overlay. The painting becomes active, while the previously active gallery becomes inactive.</p>
              <p>The overlay includes its own navigational elements, which appear when a user hovers over the left or right side of the overlay. Users can navigate between the paintings in a linear fashion. They can also close the overlay using a button that remains visible at all times.</p>
