          <h1>Serena Scalzi</h1>
          <h2>Instructional Designer, Creative Educator, and Lifelong Learner</h2>
          <p>I will complete a Curriculum and Instruction MEd with an emphasis in Educational Technology in May, after completing a certificate in Online Teaching and Training in December. I am passionate about educational technology, as I believe that education is technology&rsquo;s highest and best use. My research focuses on the intersection of education, technology, and creativity. Throughout my graduate program, I have worked as a Graduate Assistant in the Office of Online Education and participated in The Grad Academy. In the Office of Online Education, I have supported the MSI Student Success Summit, the Online General Education Academy, and the RebelReady Program. In The Grad Academy, I have participated in the Grad Rebel Writing Boot Camp, the Graduate College Communication Certification, the Post-Graduate Career Pathways Program, and the Rebel Grad Slam. I am also a proud member of ISTE, Rebels Forever, and The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi.</p>

              <p>The painting thumbnails in this gallery, which become active when a user hovers over them, are displayed in a matrix. When a user clicks on a thumbnail, the full painting is displayed on the screen. When the full painting is displayed, it acts as an overlay. The painting becomes active, while the previously active gallery becomes inactive.</p>
              <p>The overlay includes its own navigational elements, which appear when a user hovers over the left or right side of the overlay. Users can navigate between the paintings in a linear fashion. They can also close the overlay using a button that remains visible at all times.</p>
